		\begin{itemize}\itemfill
			\item successfully measured two BCM' modules at PSI
			\item only channel 1 of each chip working at low noise
			\item possible to read out two channels of independent chips at the same time
			\item SNR at \SI{1}{\kilo\volt}:
			\item shape of negative signals becomes flat before reaching the highest point
			\item rise time at positive voltage: 
			\item coupling between connected and non-connected channels
